# Crypto Lottery System

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase for a Crypto Lottery System implemented on Android Studio using Java and XML. The system integrates with Ethereum blockchain for lottery management and utilizes Solidity for smart contract development. Additionally, payment gateway implementations are incorporated for seamless cryptocurrency transactions.

## Features
1. **Lottery Participation**: Users can participate in various lotteries available on the platform through the Android application.
2. **Blockchain Integration**: The system interacts with the Ethereum blockchain for transparent and secure lottery transactions.
3. **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts written in Solidity manage the lottery transactions securely.
4. **Payment Gateway Implementations**: Payment gateways are integrated to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions for purchasing lottery tickets.
5. **User Interface**: User-friendly interface designed with XML layouts for smooth navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Android Studio**: Development  environment for building the Android application.
- **Java**: Programming language used for backend logic and functionality.
- **XML**: Markup language for designing user interface layouts.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Utilized for managing lottery transactions and ensuring transparency.
